# Sentiment Analysis
### What is sentiment analysis?
Essentially, sentiment analysis or sentiment classification fall into the broad catagory of text classification tasks where you are supplied with a phrase, or a list of phrases and your classifier is supposed to tell if the sentiment behind that is positive, negative or neutral (for binary classification problem: we don't take the third attribute). In recent tasks, sentiments like "somewhat positive" and "somewhat negative" are also being considered.
